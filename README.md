A list of really weird gene annotations


## Gene structures

### 1bp length exon

Evidence given for a 1bp length exon in Arabadopsis and different splicing models are discussed

http://www.nature.com/articles/srep18087

### 0bp length exon

The phenomenon of recursive splicing can remove sequences progressively inside an intron, so there can exist "0bp exons" that are just the splice-site sequences pasted together.

"To identify potential zero nucleotide exon-type ratchet points, we parsed the RNA-Seq alignments to identify novel splice junctions where the reads mapped to an annotated 5' splice site and an unannotated 3' splice site, and the genomic sequence at the 3' splice site junction was AG/GT"

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4529404/

### Very large number of isoforms in Dscam

"Dscam has 24 exons; exon 4 has 12 variants, exon 6 has 48 variants, exon 9 has 33 variants, and exon 17 has two variants. The combination of exons 4, 6, and 9 leads to 19,008 possible isoforms with different extracellular domains (due to differences in Ig2, Ig3 and Ig4). With two different transmembrane domains from exon 17, the total possible protein products could reach 38,016 isoforms"

## Wormbase

### Adding leader sequence to mRNA

"About 70% of C. elegans mRNAs are trans-spliced to one of two 22 nucleotide spliced leaders. SL1 is used to trim off the 5' ends of pre-mRNAs and replace them with the SL1 sequence. This processing event is very closely related to cis-splicing, or intron removal."

The region that is spliced out is called an outron

http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_transsplicingoperons/transsplicingoperons.html

### Polycistronic transcripts/operons

"A characteristic feature of the worm genome is the existence of genes organized into operons. These polycistronic gene clusters contain two or more closely spaced genes, which are oriented in a head to tail direction. They are transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA and separated into individual mRNAs by the process of trans-splicing"

## Evolution

### Possible adaptive bacteria->eukaryote HGT

A possible horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes is found in an insect that feeds on coffee beans. Changes that the gene had to undergo are covered (added poly-A tail, shine-dalgarno sequence deleted)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306691/

## Codon usage

### Alternative start codons

"The most common start codons for known Escherichia coli genes are AUG (83% of genes), GUG (14%) and UUG (3%)"

"Here, we systematically quantified translation initiation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from all 64 codons and nanoluciferase from 12 codons on plasmids designed to interrogate a range of translation initiation conditions."

## Transposons

### Cross-species BovB transposon transfers

Or "How a quarter of the cow genome came from snakes" http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/01/how-a-quarter-of-the-cow-genome-came-from-snakes/

## Regulation

### Intron mediated enhancement (IME)

It has been shown that some intron sequences can enhance expression similar to how promoter sequences work https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron-mediated_enhancement

The first intron of the UBQ10 gene in Arabidopsis exhibits IME, and "the sequences responsible for increasing mRNA accumulation are redundant and dispersed throughout the UBQ10 intron" http://www.plantcell.org/content/early/2017/04/03/tpc.17.00020.full.pdf+html
