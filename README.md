A list of really weird gene annotations


## Gene structures

### 1bp length exon

Evidence given for a 1bp length exon in Arabadopsis and different splicing models are discussed

### 0bp length exon

"To identify potential zero nucleotide exon-type ratchet points, we parsed the RNA-Seq alignments to identify novel splice junctions where the reads mapped to an annotated 5' splice site and an unannotated 3' splice site, and the genomic sequence at the 3' splice site junction was AG/GT"

### Widespread trans-splicing of different mRNAs in C. elegans

"About 70% of C. elegans mRNAs are trans-spliced to one of two 22 nucleotide spliced leaders. SL1 is used to trim off the 5' ends of pre-mRNAs and replace them with the SL1 sequence. This processing event is very closely related to cis-splicing, or intron removal."

The region that is spliced out is called an outron

## Evolution

### Possible bacteria->eukaryote HGT

A possible horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes is found in an insect that feeds on coffee beans. Changes that the gene had to undergo are covered (added poly-A tail, shine-dalgarno sequence deleted)

## Codon usage

### Alternative start codons

"The most common start codons for known Escherichia coli genes are AUG (83% of genes), GUG (14%) and UUG (3%)"

"Here, we systematically quantified translation initiation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from all 64 codons and nanoluciferase from 12 codons on plasmids designed to interrogate a range of translation initiation conditions."
