A list of really weird gene annotations


## 1bp length exon

Evidence given for a 1bp length exon in Arabadopsis and different splicing models are discussed

## 0bp length exon

"To identify potential zero nucleotide exon-type ratchet points, we parsed the RNA-Seq alignments to identify novel splice junctions where the reads mapped to an annotated 5' splice site and an unannotated 3' splice site, and the genomic sequence at the 3' splice site junction was AG/GT"
